# GeometricBrownianMotion
GBM Model using Python and Jupyter. To use, install Jupyter Notebooks and open the `.ipynb` file with it.

To make the model fit better (reducing what "dx" prints to as close to zero as possible) try changing dt (the step size) up or down to suit your needs.  

This code is made available under the GPLv3 License. In short: the upside is it's free to use or modify, the downside is I'm not responsible for anything bad happening, including losing all your money by trading with this analysis program.  
The only code not under this license is the code taken from the Wikipedia page on Geometric Brownian Motion, which is commented as such. That is available to the public for free but it didn't have any license information attached, so that goes by Wikipedia's code license rules, whatever that may be.
